#The Net Ninja Bootstrap Course

Concluded the Net Ninja Course
its really a great course to understand the basic and get you started in learning of bootstrap,
one interest part for me is the customization of bootstrap. This is what i have been trying to do for long. Net Ninja made it easier to me to understand and implement it.

I learnt alot the bootstrap components
*the tooptip
*tabs
*dropdown
* and so much more

it really a nice experience
